                        built in sensors, the VR200 can quickly detect furniture and obstacles in its path and manoeuvre easily around them. It can also overcome door thresholds and avoid stairs like a breeze. Using intelligent, ultrasonic sensors, the
                        VR200 travels precisely along skirting boards, walls and edges. Its unique D-shape means it can easily reach all corners.Thanks to a height of just 9cm, the VR200 is able to get right underneath your furniture, meaning no dirt
