                    in 1929, it succeeded in building powerful suction into a very small space. The next new departure soon came along, when Vorwerk became the first company to bring direct sales to Europe. Driven by innovations, today’s Kobold product
                    line encompasses not only the upright and canister-type vacuum cleaners, but also a robot vacuum and a window cleaner. </p>
